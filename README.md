# coordinated-microservices

Get started with this sample, which is an online store that consists of three microservices: a Catalog API, an Orders API, and a UI that calls both of the APIs. The sample includes a DevOps toolchain that is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, blue-green deployment, functional testing, issue tracking, online editing, and messaging.
